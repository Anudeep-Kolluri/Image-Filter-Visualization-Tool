# Image Filter Visualization Tool

Interactive web application designed to visualize the effects of different convolutional kernels on images. Users can upload their images, apply various predefined filters, or create custom filters to see how they affect the image.

## Key Features
- **Image Upload:** Easily upload images to the application.
- **Predefined Filters:** Apply a range of predefined filters such as edge detection, Sobel, Gaussian blur, etc.
- **Custom Filters:** Create custom filters by manually adjusting kernel values.
- **Real-Time Preview:** See the filtered image in real-time as you adjust filter parameters.
- **Grayscale Display:** Both the uploaded and filtered images are displayed in grayscale for better visualization of the filter effects.
- **Intuitive Interface:** User-friendly interface designed for easy navigation and use.

## Technical Stack
- Built with Python using the Streamlit framework for web application development.
- Leveraging libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, and PIL for image processing.
- Utilizing HTML/CSS generated by Streamlit for interface customization.
